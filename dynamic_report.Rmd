## What's going on with this data?

You need to change the contents of this Rmd! Replace the R code and markdown give below in this template document.

```{r}
logged_data <- read_csv('project2_responses.csv')

#renaming variable
logged_data <- rename(logged_data, grade =  "What was the grade of the climb?",
                      attempts = "How many attempts did you take",
                      top = "Topped?",
                      colour = "What was the colour of the climb?")

#convert v grades into numbers
logged_data$grade_numbers <- as.numeric(gsub("V", "", logged_data$grade)) 

#rearranging table
logged_data <- logged_data[,c("Timestamp", "grade", "grade_numbers", "attempts", "top", "colour")]







```

The best pet to have is a `r best_pet` of course!
